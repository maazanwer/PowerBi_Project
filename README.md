## üéì Batch Performance Dashboard

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes the academic performance of an entire university batch using **Power BI**.  
It is based on **real-world data** (4,000+ rows, 6‚Äì7 columns), which I personally collected, cleaned, and transformed from raw numeric sheets.  

The dashboard is designed to:
- Track individual student performance across 8 semesters and 20+ subjects
- Compare students against class averages, rankings, and percentiles
- Highlight anomalies, failures, and consistency patterns
- Reveal grading trends and subject difficulty across instructors
- Provide interactive exploration where each visual filters others logically

- Score distribution histogram with highlighted individual performance  
- Comparison bar chart by IDs

### ‚úÖ **3. Consistency & Anomaly Analysis**
- Scatter plot: **Average Score vs Consistency vs Rank** (bubble size scaled by inverted rank)  
- Heatmap showing pass/fail trends per student and subject  
- Insights into students with irregular performance patterns

### ‚úÖ **4. Instructor Insights**
- Average scores grouped by instructor  
- Breakdown of subject performance by instructor  
- Identifies toughest and easiest graders

### ‚úÖ **5. Individual vs Class Battle**
